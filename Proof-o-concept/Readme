AI-Powered Research Hub
Goal:
Build a web-based research management app that lets users upload, organize, and analyze
multiple research documents (PDF or text). The app automatically generates summaries, extracts
keywords, and allows collaborative tagging, linking, and note-taking.
Core Functionality
1. Document Management
- Upload multiple PDFs or text files
- Extract text content from PDFs
- Store documents and metadata (title, author, topic, tags) in a database
- View documents in a clean, scrollable preview interface
- Edit or delete uploaded files
2. Smart Analysis (AI Assistant)
- Automatically generate:
- Document summaries
- Keywords / key phrases
- Named entities (people, orgs, topics)
- Display these AI insights alongside each document
- Option to regenerate or refine summaries
3. Organization & Search
- Tag documents by topic, author, or keyword
- Filter and search documents dynamically (by tag, keyword, or title)
- Allow custom folder/group creation
4. Collaboration Features
- Add comments or notes to documents
- Link related documents (like citations or topic clusters)
- Highlight and save snippets or quotes
Tech Stack
Backend: Python (Flask or FastAPI)
Database: SQLite or PostgreSQL
Frontend: HTML + CSS (with optional JS for live search/filtering)
AI/NLP: transformers, spacy, or OpenAI API
File Handling: PyMuPDF or pdfminer.six for text extraction
Optional Extensions
- Add a chat interface: ask questions like “Summarize all papers on climate models.”
- Export summaries or notes as Markdown or PDF.
- Integrate user accounts with login and personal document collections.
- Add a visual knowledge map to show links between documents and topics.
UI / UX Ideas
- Dashboard: Grid or list of uploaded docs with small preview cards
- Side Panel: Shows AI-generated summary, keywords, and editable notes
- Top Search Bar: Live filter by title, author, tag, or keyword
- Clean Styling: Light background, color accents for tags, and subtle shadows
Example Folder Structure
ai_research_hub/
  app.py # Flask/FastAPI main app
  templates/ # HTML templates
    index.html
    upload.html
    document.html
  static/ # CSS + JS
    style.css
    script.js

Example User Flow
1. User uploads several research PDFs.
2. Backend extracts text and runs summarization + keyword extraction.
3. Summaries, tags, and key phrases are shown on the dashboard.
4. User adds manual notes, links related documents, or highlights text.
5. All changes are saved to the database for later retrieval
